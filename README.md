# Expense Tracker App with DOM Manipulation

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to create an intuitive and user-friendly Expense Tracker App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app will provide users with the ability to manage their expenses by adding, categorizing, and deleting them. Furthermore, the app will utilize Local Storage to ensure that expense data is retained even after the page is refreshed.

## Functionality

### 1. User Interface (UI)

The Expense Tracker App boasts an intuitive and visually appealing user interface designed to make expense tracking a breeze. Here's an overview of the key UI components:

- **Expense Details Input Fields**: Easily input the expense name, amount, and date using dedicated input fields.

- **Expense Category Dropdown**: Select the appropriate expense category from a dynamic dropdown menu for better organization.

- **Add Expense Button**: A simple and prominent button that triggers the addition of the entered expense to the tracker.

- **Expense Table**: A clean and organized table that showcases all expenses with crucial details such as name, amount, date, and category.

- **Total Expense Display**: Keep track of your spending with a real-time update of the total expense amount.

- **Delete Buttons**: Each expense entry features a convenient delete button for hassle-free removal.

Take control of your finances with our user-friendly interface that ensures efficient expense tracking and management.

### 2. Expense Addition and Deletion

Adding and deleting expenses is a breeze! Just enter the expense details and hit the "Add Expense" button. Our app will take care of the rest:

- **Adding Expenses**: New expenses are seamlessly added to the table, with the total expense amount updated accordingly.

- **Deleting Expenses**: You can effortlessly remove expenses by clicking on the dedicated delete button.

### 3. Data Persistence

We understand the importance of your data. That's why we've implemented data persistence using the Local Storage browser API:

- **Save and Load**: Your entered expense data is automatically saved to Local Storage. When you return to the app, your expenses will be waiting for you.

### 4. Advanced DOM Manipulation

Our Expense Tracker App utilizes cutting-edge DOM manipulation techniques, ensuring that the UI dynamically reflects any changes:

- **Real-time Updates**: Whether you're adding or deleting expenses, the expense table and total amount are updated in real-time.

### 5. Number and Date Handling

We've harnessed the power of JavaScript's number and date objects to enhance your experience:

- **Numeric Calculations**: Effortlessly handle expense calculations.

- **User-friendly Dates**: Expense dates are formatted in a human-readable manner, making tracking easier.

### 6. Expense Categorization

Categorizing expenses is a breeze with our app:

- **Dynamic Categories**: The category dropdown is populated dynamically based on available categories.

- **Organized Display**: Expenses are neatly sorted and displayed according to their respective categories in the table.

## Technology Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Local Storage Browser API

## Additional Functionality

As an added bonus, we've also implemented a search functionality. You can easily search for expenses by their name, making it even simpler to manage your financial records.

## Short Example

Suppose a user adds an expense:

- Expense Name: Dinner
- Amount: $40
- Date: 2023-08-01
- Category: Dining

Upon clicking "Add Expense," the app will dynamically update the table:
